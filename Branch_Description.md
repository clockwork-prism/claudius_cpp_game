# Branch Description

## Basics
Basics is a branch that essentially presents the "Hello world" version of the program. Using only cin and cout, no variables, and no if statements or other advanced control loops. The game is being coded in VSCode, using the MinGW compiler. VSCode's website has excellent tutorials for getting started, as the game evolves and gets more complex, there will eventually be a make file associated with it. To put off make files as much as possible, the game will be kept to one script for as long as is reasonable. In this branch, the game will print out a "title screen" and ask the user to make a selection. The selection doesn't do anything, and the program exits as soon as a choice is made.

## VariablesAndConstants
Makes use of variables for displaying the title screen. Constants are used for the horizontal border and empty middle frame section, since these should not be changed. In future versions, these will be generated by functions that will make it easier to extend. For now, the game still doesn't quite run but the code is much more readable.

## Arrays
Instead of variables, title screen is created using a std::array object. While there is some repetition, the full screen is visible in the array initialization. Also, now the screen printing is much cleaner and makes more sense. Once for loops are introduced, the titleScreen variable will be created in a much more straightforward way. Printing out the full title screen will also become much better.

## IfElseIf
Almost a game! Introduces if else statements to the "game", where the selection actually leads to different outcomes. A pure if else based game would be incredibly difficult to execute, however, so again only a concept is demonstrated. The next branch will finally make this a real game by introducing loops.

## Loops
AKA "Finally a Real Game!" This branch introduces while loops, and finally creates a game like experience. Also introduced are enums and switch statements, which help streamline the process of creating games with different states.
