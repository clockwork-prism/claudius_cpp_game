# Claudius: Praetorian Prefect

This game is more of a learning project than anything else, aimed at using basic C++ concepts to build a text based strategy game set in the late Roman empire (hence the name which abbreviates to CPP). For an overview of what each branch is doing (aside from looking at commit history) the Branch_description.md doc goes over everything in detail.

## Goals
This is intended to demonstrate C++ concepts like string manipulation, OOP, and streams. Each iteration of the game will be stored in a separate branch, checking out each branch will showcase different concepts as the game grows in complexity.

## Game description
You will play as Claudius, a Praetorian Prefect (head of the imperial guard) who is out on campaign in Gaul defending against Germanic tribes when his troops urge him to rebel and seize the imperial throne. You will be presented with scenarios and asked what to do next, with the ultimate goal of defeating Severus, the current emperor, and becoming the new Augustus.
