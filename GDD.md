## Project Statement
Play as a rebellious general in the Roman Empire at the end of the third century. Your goal is to defeat Severus, the emperor, and be recognized as sole ruler of Rome. Gameplay is text based, presenting scenarios and seeking input. ASCII art is used to illustrate current scene.

## Project Description
CPP is a text based game, but also uses ASCII art to show maps or layout of armies. Choices can include moving camp, entrenching further, sending out scouts, pursuing leads, etc. With these commands you will maneuver your army around the western empire, ultimately seeking to do battle with Severus. You start out with not enough men to take on Severus, but some frontier legions may be willing to back you and Severus is haughty and will be easy to lure into a trap. There are multiple paths to a final victory.
